<h1> Chanda </h1>
<i>Donation tracking made easy!</i>

<b> Description </b>  

My church/mosque reached out to me to build an app for people who want to keep track of their donations. The word "Chanda" means donations in Urdu the language. This is a simple app I put together during the weekend. 

- Ability to add a custom name for the donation
- Ability to attach a receipt for the donation by picking the receipt either from the iPhone photo library or taking a new picture 
- Ability to record the payments as individual transactions 
- Persists the donations in a local SQLite database
